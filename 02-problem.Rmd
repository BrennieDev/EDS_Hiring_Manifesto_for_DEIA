# Problem

The standardized hiring process for environmental data science positions leads to exclusion of diverse candidates

Employers are missing a lot of applicants by:

-   Reach: not sharing hiring information to large enough pool

-   Transparency: application process is complex

-   Timing: can be a long process

-   Documentation: normalized document requirement that might not be a means to get in the door

-   Titles: title may not accurately match responsibilites

Chapter 3 - Approach sets out to curate sharable resources that raise awareness about hurdles and biases and present best practices to address or overcome these problem spaces.

# Problem

The standardized hiring process for environmental data science positions leads to exclusion of diverse candidates

We are missing a lot of applicants by:

-   Reach: not sharing hiring information to large enough pool

-   Transparency: application process is complex

-   Timing: can be a long process

-   Normalized document requirement that might not be a means to get in the door

-   Titles: titles don't describe what we do.

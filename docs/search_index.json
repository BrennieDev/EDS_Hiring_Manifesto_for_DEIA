Abiding by the DEIA principles, the approach detailed in this manifesto will serve as a primary standardized resource for hiring managers as well as job seekers in EDS. We hope this manifesto allows the discipline to wholly embrace an inclusive &amp; transparent recruitment process and help create a professional culture where all identities can participate, thrive, and have satisfying and rewarding careers. Here we lay out the problem space and provide approaches to expand diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) in the hiring process.
